# Mobile Technical Assignment

### Assignment: MovieDB Viewer

Your task is to create a mobile application, either iOS or Android, that consumes the API from TheMovieDatabase.

**Core Features:**

You have complete freedom to decide which functionalities to build into the project. Nonetheless, there are two features we would like to ask you to build.

- Filter: Users should be able to filter the movie list based on genres.
- Favorites: Users should be able to locally mark a movie as a favorite. Favorites should be viewable in a separate list and should persist across app launches.
  Guidelines:
- You're free to use any architecture you find suitable. However, we would like to see your ability to structure a project, separate concerns, and manage dependencies.
- Show us your skills in managing network requests, and handling concurrency. We expect the app to remain responsive even while fetching data from the API.
- The UI doesn't need to be complex, but we do expect some attention to detail. Show us what you can do!

> **Submission:**<br> >**Once you are ready with the solution, please create a PR to main. We will receive a notification that your solution is ready for review, and assign one of our colleagues to it.**

- We value quality over quantity.
- Double check that your project compiles without errors.
